# DEVELOPMENT

This project uses a vibe-coding workflow: fast iteration, AI-assisted changes, and minimal structure during early development. The main file is intentionally long because AI works best when all relevant logic is in one place. Do not split files unless functionality is stable and clearly separable.

Guidelines:

- Keep related logic together; avoid premature abstraction.
- Add comments explaining intent, assumptions, and experiments.
- Write simple, readable, straightforward code.
- Keep the main file the "source of truth" until the project matures.

This is a creative, iterative environment—optimize for flow now, structure later.
